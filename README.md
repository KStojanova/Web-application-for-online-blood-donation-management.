# Web-application-for-online-blood-donation-management.
This project was my graduate thesis. The blood donor application groups all blood donors under one group. The application aims to bring blood donors under one roof so that they can donate blood more easily. At the moment, blood donors should seek blood donation centers for any questions or blood donations without pre-scheduled appointments which leads to possible waiting and this is a waste of time. This application will help to easily find blood donors. Blood donors can register to find out about the blood banks closest to them. Organizations such as hospitals can also register and ask for blood or donors in their particular area.Services offered by the web application: Possibility for the blood donor to register online and donate blood. Possibility to make appointments when it suits him. Opportunity for citizens to search for donors by cities and by blood type. Hospitals to look for blood types when they lack them.
